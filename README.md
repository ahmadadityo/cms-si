# cms-si
Content Management for System Information

Berikut adalah terjemahan kalimat tersebut ke dalam bahasa Inggris:

The purpose of creating this program is to make it easier and faster for me to build different information systems, even though the syntax and process flow are always the same and repetitive.

Thatâ€™s why I developed CMS-SI, so that whenever I create a module, I only need to configure the required components and handle data retrieval/storage according to the needs."


This program was created only for the first version as a prototype using native PHP, and it does not fully use a framework yet, although it is planned to use Laravel in the future.
